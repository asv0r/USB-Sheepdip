# USB-Sheepdip

Prototype sheep dip appliance for USB security in airgapped environments to run on a Raspberry Pi

Based on George Pajari's 2014 paper for CanSecWest (https://github.com/pajari/usbsheepdip/releases/download/v0.0.1/USB.Flash.Storage.Threats.and.Air-Gapped.Networks.pdf); this will be a simple script or set of scripts to securely copy files from USB to USB across an airgap.

It will be written for bash to run on Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi, but may be ported to Python or similar later.
